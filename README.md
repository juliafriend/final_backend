PackMan - Your Packing Assistant

Concept: An app to assist the user in packing for an upcoming trip. The model is to create a "packing list" with full CRUD functionality. Users can input day #, date, outfits, etc to assist in planning their packing. The first map displays basic cards with outline for packing, and 2nd map shows outfit details to get inspired!

Tech: Java Backend with Spring-Boot Framework, PostGres DB, full CRUD operations React Frontend with JS, CSS styling

Technical Challenges: 
--spring.io : I first initialized this project from spring.io and was able to get the project working in my local environment. I was using Java 18 (which I later found out was deprecated and would not deploy to heroku) so I ended up scrapping this entire version of the project and started over with a Spring-Boot application created from VSCode with Java extensions and Java 17. 

--React frontend : I followed the Spring-React-Stack markdown with a static folder in my backend that contains app.js, index.html  and style.css within. This rendered everything I wanted to the app so I stuck with this. I did make a separate front-end repo 

Styling: Styled with CSS using Grid and Flexboxes
